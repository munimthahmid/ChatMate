1. each user will have a team, and team id
2. each pdf that is being uploaded for training will also be stored under the team id(that we will get from user details) and will store them in backend.
3. in frontned there will be another page that is resource page, where we will display all the pdfs(somehow) under the team name. 
whoo! that's a wrap
